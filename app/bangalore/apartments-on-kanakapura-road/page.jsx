                Located towards the south of Bangalore, Kanakapura Road has
                developed to become a self-sufficient location, in the last few
                years â€“ making it a preferred choice for real estate developers
                and homebuyers. Schools including Kumarans, BGS, JSS & DPS and
                hospitals like Apollo, Fortis, and BGS are some renowned names
                in this locale. A host of supermarkets ranging from Metro to
                D-Mart and Family Mart, situated within the vicinity of the
                residential areas add more value. Adventure sports centers like
                Dirt Mania and Raceway Motorsports are located in close
                proximity to the region.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for connectivity, Kanakapura Road is well-connected to the
                NICE Ring Road and Outer Ring Road. The upcoming metro promises
                to make commuting across the city, easy. Access to the IT hubs
                of Bannerghatta Road, Sarjapur Outer Ring Road & Electronic City
                and to well-developed localities like JP Nagar, Banashankari,
                and Jayanagar, make Kanakapura road an ideal location.
